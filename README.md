# user-credit-card-clustering-project
The dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months.It uses 18 columns to define various aspects of the customer's spending. habits. 
We will use K Means Clustering to divide the customers into various groups and then use pca to reduce the 18 features to 2 features to visualize the clusters. This will help us in recognising our target customers and use better customer advertising.
